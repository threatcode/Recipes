threat-linux-recipes
==================

This repository will host various "Threat Linux Recipes", or live-build configurations which can generate various images of Threat Linux.
Hopefully, these scripts will be useful even if they are just used for reference. Fast internet required as well as ample space to 
build and generate an ISO file....good luck with your Threat cooking. Do you have an interesting recipe ? Send it over to info at threat dot org!
